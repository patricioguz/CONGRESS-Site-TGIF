        <h2 class="text-center">ABOUT US</h2>
        <p class="text-justify">Openness, accountability, and honesty define government transparency. In a free society, transparency is government's obligation 
          to share information with citizens. It is at the heart of how citizens hold their public officials accountable. Here at TGIF we 
          believe that government should be transparent.  
        Governments exist to serve the people. Information on how officials conduct the public business and spend taxpayer money must 
          be readily available and easily understood. This transparency allows good and just governance.  Transparency promotes 
          accountability and provides information for citizens about what their Government is doing.
        We also believe that government should be participatory. Public engagement enhances the Government's effectiveness and improves 
          the quality of its decisions. Knowledge is widely dispersed in society, and public officials benefit from having access to that 
          dispersed knowledge. We invite you to use our site to become actively engaged in American government.
        TGIF works to disclose information in forms that the public can readily find and use. We solicit public feedback to identify 
          information of greatest use to the public.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-5 text-center">BACKGROUND HISTORY OF GOVERNMENT TRANSPARENCY</h2>

        <p class="text-justify mt-3">In the West, the idea that government should be open to public scrutiny and susceptible to public opinion dates back at least 
          to the time of the Enlightenment, when many philosophes made an attack on absolutist doctrine of state secrecy, a core part of 
          their intellectual project. The passage of formal legislative instruments to this end can also be traced to this time with Sweden, 
          for example, (which then included Finland as a Swedish-governed territory) enacting free press legislation as part of its 
          constitution (Freedom of the Press Act, 1766). This approach, and that of the philosophes more broadly, is strongly related 
          to recent historiography on the eighteenth-century public sphere.
         Influenced by Enlightenment thought, the revolutions in America (1776) and France (1789), freedom of the press enshrined 
           provisions and requirements for public budgetary accounting and freedom of the press in constitutional articles. In the 
           nineteenth century, attempts by Metternichean statesmen to row back on these measures were vigorously opposed by a number of 
           eminent liberal politicians and writers, Bentham, Mill and Acton prominent among the latter.
         Open government is widely seen to be a key hallmark of contemporary democratic practice and is often linked to the passing of 
           freedom of information legislation. Scandinavian countries claim to have adopted the first freedom of information legislation, 
           dating the origins of its modern provisions to the eighteenth century and Finland continuing the presumption of openness after 
           gaining independence in 1917, passing its Act on Publicity of Official Documents in 1951 (superseded by new legislation in 
           1999).
        The United States passed its Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in 1966, FOIAs, Access to Information Acts (AIAs) or equivalent 
          laws were passed in Denmark and Norway in 1970.</p>
